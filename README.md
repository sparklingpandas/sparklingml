# sparklingml
Machine Learning Pipeline Stages for Spark (exposed in Scala/Java + Python)

## Why?

SparklingML's goal is to expose additional machine learning stages for Spark with the pipeline interface.

## Status

Super early! Come join!

## Building

Sparkling ML consists of two components, a Python component and a Java/Scala component. The Python component depends on having the Java/Scala component pre-build which can be done by running `./build/sbt package`.


The Python component depends on the package listed in requirements.txt (as well as part of setup.py). Development and testing also requires spacy, nose, codecov, pylint, and flake8.


The script `build_and_package.sh` builds & tests both the Scala and Python code.

### Tests

>    <BLANKLINE>
>        Only loading the 'en' tokenizer.

Make sure you've installed spacy & the en language pack (`python -m spacy download en`)
